# Simple Image Editor (Java version)

This code was written following the logic paradigm of programming.

The program allows the manipulation of pre-defined images in several 
ways via the implementation of different class types and interfaces:

- ImageFormat (Abstract class)
- Image (Extends ImageFormat)
- ImageCompressed (Extends ImageFormat)
- Pixel (Class)
- ADT-Image
- ImageOperations (Interface)
- ImageOperationsCompressed (Interface)

This program runs an interactive menu where the user can create and edit images.
